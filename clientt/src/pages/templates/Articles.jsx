      quote: "Chandigarh's urban planning has a rich history, initially designed by the renowned architect Le Corbusier in the 1950s. However, as the city has rapidly expanded over the decades, it faced criticism for neglecting green belts and open spaces, which are essential for maintaining ecological balance and enhancing the quality of life. Recognizing these challenges, city planners have taken significant steps to integrate green architecture and sustainable practices into new developments. Current initiatives include the creation of extensive parks, green corridors, and urban forests that not only beautify the city but also serve as vital lungs for urban air quality. Furthermore, Chandigarh is committed to future-proofing its urban landscape by incorporating smart city concepts that prioritize sustainability, such as rainwater harvesting, solar energy utilization, and efficient waste management systems. This holistic approach not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also sets a precedent for future urban developments, ensuring that Chandigarh remains a model of sustainable urban living for generations to come.",
